(Written   Report 30%,Group   Presentation   10%)
Overview of the Assignment:The   objective   of   this   assignment   is   to   allow   student   groups   to   apply   the   concepts   taught in class and   further   their knowledge on IT and networking.   When doing research   beyond lesson materials, students are encouraged to check the validity of the sources   before using   it   in the assignment.
Rationale of Group AssignmentThe   rationale   of   the   group   assignment   is   to   enable   collaborative   learning   with   your   peers   and   learning   to   work   as   a   team,   which   is   common   in   workplace   environment.   Students    learn    to    apply    theories    taught    in    class    and    in    textbooks,    to      real    world   situations. In line   with this objective, students are not allowed to reuse old assignments   or submit   projects from   previous semesters or copy   largely from   sources,   particularly   from the   internet.
Forming GroupStudents are to form. groups of   4-5 members per group. As this is a group assignment,   each member is expected to put   in   his/her fair share of effort   into the   assignment.   It   is   essential that groups manage their group effectively to complete   this   assignment.Students should try to resolve group dynamics issues within the   group,   and   may seek   the mediation through the lecturer as early as   possible.   Last   minute   mediation will   not   be    entertained.    Students    may    request    for    peer    evaluation    as    a    final      resort    if    all   mediation fails.Finally, the lecturer reserves the right to assign a mark   to an individual student different   from the rest of the group if that student is deemed not to have put   in   his/her fair share   of effort into the   assignment.
